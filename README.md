# Java Machine Learning with SMILE
# Project Overview
This repository contains a Java-based machine learning project, showcasing the use of the SMILE library to perform linear regression. It serves as an exploration of Java's capabilities in handling data science tasks, 
offering an alternative to more commonly used Python-based solutions.

# Features
Linear Regression Implementation: Utilizes the SMILE library for a linear regression model.
Data Handling: Demonstrates efficient data processing and manipulation in Java.
Model Evaluation: Includes methods for evaluating the model's performance.

# Usage
The main application demonstrates reading data from an Excel file, training a linear regression model with the SMILE library, and evaluating its performance.
Data format and structure should follow the example provided in the excel file.
